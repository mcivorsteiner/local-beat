I'm very pleased with this.  You've made a very good effort at designing a
robust OO JS MVC framework.  You should be proud.  You've really spent time
coming up with a nice, neat, clean API.  I really respect and appreciate that.

Your JS code is really readable because of these decisions.  While I may
differ in my opinion as to where something belongs, we're discussing
implementation details, not design directions.
